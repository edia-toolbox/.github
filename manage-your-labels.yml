# Labels used in the EDIA toolbox organization
#
# Add new labels with their specification here. 
# These labels are synced to all repos in the organization every 15 minutes by this [Action](.github/workflows/sync-labels.yml). 
# We could also add labels selectively to subgroups of repos.
# for details see: https://github.com/actions-automation/manage-your-labels/tree/main
